# personal-blog-website-project
### Overview
This is a project where a personal blog/diary website is built using EJS. It also relies on Express as well as Node.<br><br>
It's very minimalistic and it's got a header up with a navbar and your brand and then at the bottom it's got a sticky footer.
There are 3 pages; the home page, the about us page and also a contact us page. All of this is generated using EJS partials.
### Usage & Features
* When you head over to the home page, this is going to have all of your blog posts on here listed in chronological but the actual blog content will be truncated to only 100 characters.
* When you click on read more, it will take you to an individual page of each of your blog posts and you can read them independently on a single page.
* There is also a hidden page that allows you to compose your diary. When you create a new post here, it gets put right on the home page and a brand new page is created just for that new post. In the URL, if you write your post title that you created and hit enter, you will be taken to the page where that blog post exists.
